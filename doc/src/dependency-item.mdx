# Dependency Item

wedi supports different kinds of dependency items, including

- classes
- instances and values
- factory functions

## `key` of a Dependency Item

When you provide a dependency item (type `DependencyItem`), you're actually injecting a pair of _key_ & _value_. The value is the dependency item, and the _key_ is the identifier of it. Specially, a ES6 class could be the _key_ and the value and the same time.

_key_ is an identifier returned by calling `createIdentifier`.

Not that `key` or identifier is required when providing values, instances or factory methods but optional when providing classes.

```ts
import { createIdentifier } from 'wedi'

export interface IPlatform {
  // properties
  // methods
}

export const IPlatformService = createIdentifier<IPlatformService>('platform')
```

_You can use the same name for a variable and a type in TypeScript._

## Class as Dependency

An ES6 class could be a dependency item. You can declare its dependencies in its constructor. wedi would analyze dependency relation among different classes and instantiate them correctly.

You can use `Need` to declare that `FileService` depends on `IPlatformService`.

```ts
class FileService {
  constructor(@Need(IPlatformService) private logService: IPlatformService) {}
}
```

wedi would get or instantiates a `IPlatformService` before it instantiates `FileService`. And if it could not instantiate a `IPlatformService` it would throw an error.

And identifiers created by `createIdentifier` could also be used to define dependency relationship. It's equivalent to the example above.

```ts
class SomeService {
  constructor(@IPlatformService private platform: IPlatformService) {}
}
```

You can also use the `Optional` decorator to declare an optional dependency.

```ts
class FileService {
  constructor(@Optional(OptionalDependency) private op?: OptionalDependency) {}
}
```

If `OptionalDependency` is not provided, wedi would not throw an error but return `null` instead to instantiate `FileService`.

## Value or Instance as Dependency

It's easy to provide a value as dependency.

```ts
const configDep = [IConfig, { useValue: '2020' }]
```

## Factory Function as Dependency

You can create a dependency via `useFactory` that gives the control flow back to you on initializing.

```ts
const useDep = [IUserService, {
  useFactory: (http: IHTTPService): IUserService => new TimeSerialUserService(http, TIME)ï¼Œ
  deps: [IHTTPService] // this factory depends on IHTTPService.
}]
```

## Provide Items

Finally, you should wrap all items in an array and pass them to the constructor of `DependencyCollection`.

```ts
const dependencies = [
  LogService,
  FileService,
  [IConfig, { useValue: '2020' }],
  [
    IUserService,
    {
      useFactory: (http: IHTTPService): IUserService =>
        new TimeSerialUserService(http, TIME),
      deps: [IHTTPService]
    }
  ],
  [IHTTPService, WebHTTPService]
]
```

## Singleton Dependency

For dependencies that should be singleton in the application, it's recommended to use `registerSingleton`.

```ts
registerSingleton(/* a dependency item */)
```

Dependencies would be provided by the root provider. In another word, the provider which is constructed without a `parent` parameter.

## Lazy Instantiation
