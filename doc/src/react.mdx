wedi provides API let you use dependency injection in React conveniently.

## Class Component as Provider

The `Provide` decorator could inject items into the decorated component and its child components.

```ts
import { Provide } from 'wedi';
import { FileService } from 'services/file';
import { IPlatformService } from 'services/platform';

@Provide([
  FileService,
  [IPlatformService, { useClass: MobilePlatformService } ];
])
class ClassComponent extends Component {
  // FileService and IPlatformService is accessible in the component and its children
}
```

## Class Component as Consumer

If you would like consume dependencies in a class component, you should assign `contextType` to be `InjectionContext` and get dependencies using the `Inject` decorator.

```ts
import { Inject, InjectionContext } from 'wedi'
import { IPlatformService } from 'services/platform'

class ClassConsumer extends Component {
  static contextType = InjectionContext

  @Inject(FileService) fileService!: FileService // accessible to all methods of this class
}
```

A class component can consume items provided by itself.

```ts
import { Inject, InjectionContext, Provide } from 'wedi';
import { IPlatformService } from 'services/platform';

@Provide([
  FileService,
  [IPlatformService, { useClass: MobilePlatformService }];
])
class ClassComponent extends Component {
  static contextType = InjectionContext;

  @Inject(IPlatformService) platformService!: IPlatformService; // this is MobilePlatformService
}
```

You can pass `true` as the second parameter of `Inject` to indicate that a dependency is optional.

```ts
class ClassComponent extends Component {
  static contextType = InjectionContext

  @Inject(CanBeNullService, true) canBeNullService?: CanBeNullService // this can be null
}
```

## Functional Component as Provider

`useCollection` and `InjectionLayer` could make functional components as providers and make sure that dependencies wouldn't get re-instantiated when components re-render.

```tsx
import { useCollection, Provider } from 'wedi'

function FunctionProvider() {
  const collection = useCollection([FileService])

  return (
    <Provider collection={collection}>
      {/* Child components can use FileService. */}
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

You could also use injectors directly. But this is only recommended when the injector is outside of the React component tree.

```tsx
const injectorFromAnOtherPartOfYourProgram = getInjector()

function YourReactRoot(props: { injector: Injector }) {
  return (
    <Provider injector={props.injector}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <YourReactRoot
    injector={injectorFromAnotherPartOfYourProgram}
  ></YourReactRoot>,
  containerEl
)
```

In this way, you could easily integrate React with other part of you application easily.

You can see that when a component tries to get a dependency, it would always ask the **nearest** provider for it, which means you could use scoped state management with wedi.

## Functional Component as Consumer

`useDependency` can help you to hook in dependencies. You can assign the second parameter `true` to mark the injected dependency as optional.

```tsx
import { useDependency } from 'wedi'
import { FileService } from 'services/file'
import { LogService } from 'services/log'

function FunctionConsumer() {
  const fileService: FileService = useDependency(FileService)
  const log: LogService | null = useDependency(LogService, true)

  return {
    /* use dependencies */
  }
}
```

Note that functional cannot consume items provided by itself.

## Multi-Layered Injector System

injectors of wedi could have child components and React components could have child components. Combined, you could use multi-layered injector system in React seamlessly.

```tsx
@Provide([
  [IConfig, { useValue: 'A' }],
  [IConfigRoot, { useValue: 'inRoot' }]
])
class ParentProvider extends Component {
  render() {
    return <ChildProvider></ChildProvider>
  }
}

@Provide([[IConfig, { useValue: 'B' }]])
class ChildProvider extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Consumer></Consumer>
  }
}

function Consumer() {
  const config = useDependency(IConfig)
  const rootConfig = useDependency(IConfigRoot)

  return (
    <div>
      {config}, {rootConfig}
    </div> // <div>B, inRoot</div>
  )
}
```

## Inject React Component

You could inject React Component as a dependency, too.

```tsx
const IDropdown = createIdentifier<any>('dropdown')
const IConfig = createIdentifier<any>('config')

const WebDropdown = function() {
  const dep = useDependency(IConfig) // could use dependencies in its host environment
  return <div>WeDropdown, {dep}</div>
}

@Provide([
  [IDropdown, { useValue: WebDropdown }],
  [IConfig, { useValue: 'wedi' }]
])
class Header extends Component {
  static contextType = InjectionContext

  @Inject(IDropdown) private dropdown: any

  render() {
    const Dropdown = this.dropdown
    return <Dropdown></Dropdown> // WeDropdown, wedi
  }
}
```
