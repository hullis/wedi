## What is wedi?

**wedi** is a lightweight toolkit to let you use dependency injection (DI) pattern in TypeScript and especially React with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

_This guide assumes basic knowledge of TypeScript, React and dependency injection pattern. If you are totally innocent of any idea above, it might not be the best idea to get started with wedi._

Install wedi via npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install wedi

# or
yarn add wedi
```

Add you need to enable decorator in tsconfig.json.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Declare a Dependency

Declare something that another class or React component could depend on is very simple. It could just be easy as a ES6 class!

```tsx
class AuthenticationService {
  avatar = 'https://img.yourcdn.com/avatar'
}
```

wedi let you declare other kinds of dependencies such as plain values and factory functions. Read Dependencies for more details.

## Use in React

You could provide a dependency in a React component, and use it in its child components.

```tsx
function App() {
  const collection = useCollection([AuthenticationService])

  return <Provider collection={collection}>
    <DeeplyWrapped>
      <Profile />
    </DeeplyWrapper>
  </Provider>
}

function Profile() {
  const authS = useDependency(AuthenticationService)

  return <img src={authS.avatar} />
}
```

## With RxJS

wedi provide some Hooks that helps you use wedi with RxJS smoothly.

```tsx
```
